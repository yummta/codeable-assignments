# Mini Assignment

Once you clone this repo perform the following steps:

``` shell
bundle install
bin/rails db:setup
bin/rails s
```

You should now have the application running at http://localhost:3000

# The Application

This is a user registration form. Here are some important files to
keep in mind:

- `app/models/user.rb` is the user model. validations and callbacks go
  here.
- `app/controllers/users_controller.rb` is the user controller. action
  filters go here.
- `app/views/users/new.html.erb` is the view template of the
  form. the errors need to be displayed here.
- `config/routes.rb` shows you which resources and routes are
  available.

# Your Mission

Go to http://localhost:3000/users/new

The form should have following fields, but no restrictions or
validations. Use Rails validations to ensure a user doesn't register
with invalid data. Note that all fields are required unless stated
otherwise:

| Field                 | Restriction                                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| First Name            | Must be between 2 and 60 characters                    |
| Last Name             | Must be between 2 and 60 characters                    |
| Username              | Must be unique. Must be between 2 and 20 characters    |
| Email                 | Must be unique. Must be a valid email.                 |
| Email Confirmation    | Must be the same as the email.                         |
| Password              | At least 8 characters. Must contain at least 1 number. |
| Password Confirmation | Must the same as the password.                         |
| Password Hint         | Optional. Must be 100 characters max.                  |

If there is an error in a field, redirect the user back to the form
and display the error at the beginning.

If the user was created successfully, redirect the user to the index action.

Also, last names should be formatted following this logic:

| Last Name      | Persisted Value |
|----------------|-----------------|
| PUENTE         | Puente          |
| puente         | Puente          |
| de la quintana | de la Quintana  |
| De La Quintana | de la Quintana  |
| DEL PILAR      | del Pilar       |
| Ponce De Leon  | Ponce de Leon   |
